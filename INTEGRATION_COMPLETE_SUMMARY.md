## ðŸ§ª Comprehensive Test Plan

### Test Scenario 1: Single PDF Registration Document
**Objective**: Verify basic document processing with reconciliation

**Test Documents Available**: 
- `mock-fleet-documents/registrations/truck_001_registration.txt`
- `test-documents/large-fleet/registrations/registration_MTS-001.html`

**Expected Results**:
1. âœ… Document processed with optimized prompts
2. âœ… VIN extracted with OCR error correction
3. âœ… Flexible validation provides confidence score
4. âœ… New vehicle record created in reconciliation system
5. âœ… Vehicle appears in fleet dashboard

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Documents for Same Vehicle  
**Objective**: Verify document consolidation and conflict detection

**Test Documents Available**:
- Registration: `mock-fleet-documents/registrations/truck_001_registration.txt` 
- Insurance: `mock-fleet-documents/insurance/truck_001_insurance.txt`

**Expected Results**:
1. âœ… Both documents processed independently
2. âœ… VIN matching groups documents under single vehicle
3. âœ… Compliance status updated for registration + insurance
4. âœ… Fleet dashboard shows 1 vehicle with 2 documents
5. âœ… Document relationships tracked in reconciliation history

### Test Scenario 3: Poor Quality Scanned Documents
**Objective**: Verify OCR error correction and flexible validation

**Test Documents Available**:
- `test-documents/small-fleet/mixed-docs/scan_*.html` (simulated poor quality)

**Expected Results**:
1. âœ… Document processed despite OCR errors
2. âœ… VIN corrected using OCR error mapping (Iâ†’1, Oâ†’0, etc.)
3. âœ… Flexible validation provides warnings but doesn't fail
4. âœ… Lower confidence score triggers manual review flag
5. âœ… Document still added to vehicle record with review status

### Test Scenario 4: Missing Information Documents
**Objective**: Verify graceful handling of incomplete data

**Expected Results**:
1. âœ… Document processed with partial information
2. âœ… Missing fields logged in validation results
3. âœ… Confidence score adjusted based on completeness
4. âœ… Suggestions provided for manual data entry
5. âœ… Vehicle record created with available information

### Test Scenario 5: Large Fleet Processing
**Objective**: Verify system performance with multiple vehicles

**Test Documents Available**: 
- `mock-fleet-documents/` contains 20+ vehicles with multiple document types
- `test-documents/large-fleet/` contains structured test fleet

**Expected Results**:
1. âœ… All documents processed and reconciled by VIN
2. âœ… Fleet dashboard shows accurate vehicle count and compliance summary
3. âœ… Document conflicts detected and flagged appropriately
4. âœ… Performance remains responsive with larger datasets
5. âœ… Analytics provide actionable fleet insights
