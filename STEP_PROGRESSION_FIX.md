# 🔧 Step Progression Fix - Fleet Onboarding

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The fleet onboarding was getting stuck at **Step 2** instead of progressing to **Step 3** after document processing completed.

## 🔍 Root Cause
In the recent data flow fix, I incorrectly set the step progression in `handleDocumentProcessingComplete` to go to **Step 2**, but:

- **Step 2**: "Processing VIN Data" - meant for VIN list processing workflow
- **Step 3**: "Review Vehicle Data" - meant for document processing workflow  

The document processing workflow should skip Step 2 entirely and go directly from Step 1 → Step 3.

## 🔧 Fix Applied
**File**: `src/App.tsx` - OnboardingPage component
**Change**: Updated step progression in `handleDocumentProcessingComplete`

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
setStep(2); // Move to review step

// AFTER (correct):  
setStep(3); // Move to review step (step 3 is "Review Vehicle Data")
```

## 🎯 Expected Flow Now

### Document Processing Workflow:
1. **Step 1**: Choose "🤖 AI Document Processing" method
2. **Document Upload**: Upload mock documents via DocumentUploadModal
3. **Processing**: DocumentUploadModal shows progress bar (0% → 100%)
4. **Step 3**: "Review Vehicle Data" - shows extracted vehicle information
5. **Completion**: Vehicles are saved to persistent storage and appear in Fleet Management

### Step Breakdown:
- **Step 1**: Method selection and file upload
- **Step 2**: ⏭️ **SKIPPED** for document processing (only used for VIN list processing)
- **Step 3**: Review extracted vehicle data and complete onboarding

## 🚀 Test Instructions

The fix is now active. Try the document processing flow:

1. **Stay in Fleet Onboarding tab**
2. **Upload mock documents** via "🤖 AI Document Processing"  
3. **Wait for processing to complete** (progress bar reaches 100%)
4. **Should now automatically progress to Step 3** showing "Review Vehicle Data"
5. **Complete the review** to finish onboarding
6. **Switch to Fleet Management tab** to see all 20 trucks

The onboarding should now flow smoothly from document upload → processing → review → completion!
