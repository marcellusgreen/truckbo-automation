# Smoke Test Checklist (2025-09-26)

## Environment
- Node: v22.17.1
- NPM: 11.4.2

## Execution Status
> Automated execution not performed in the CLI harness (UI flows require interactive browser + backend services). The checklist below documents the required steps and expected observations for the baseline run. Mark outcomes manually when executed outside the harness.

## Tests
