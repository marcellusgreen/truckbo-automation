# Smoke Test Checklist (2025-10-07)

## Environment
- Node: v22.17.1
- NPM: 11.4.2
- Flags: VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true during run
- Notes: CLI harness lacks interactive UI; execute in full dev environment and attach artifacts afterward.

## Execution Status
> Pending manual execution. Follow the checklist below in a browser session with backend services running; archive logs under docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/logs-20251007.md and data-shape JSON captures in docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/data-shapes/.

## Tests

### 1. Fleet Dashboard Load
- [ ] Start dev servers: 
pm run dev:api.
- [ ] Log in with seeded account.
- [ ] Navigate to _Dashboard_.
- Expected: Stats populate from centralizedFleetDataService.getFleetStats(), no console errors.

### 2. Manual Add Vehicle
- [ ] Go to _Fleet_ ? + New Vehicle.
- [ ] Submit valid vehicle via AddVehicleModal.
- Expected: persistentFleetStorage.addVehicles (or adapter) fires, vehicle appears after refresh, no duplicates.

### 3. Bulk CSV Upload
- [ ] Open BulkUploadModal and upload sample from downloadSampleCSV.
- Expected: Success toast, new vehicles persist through reload (centralizedFleetDataService.initializeData).

### 4. Document Ingestion Pipeline
- [ ] Launch DocumentUploadModal or MultiBatchDocumentUploadModal.
- [ ] Upload sample doc, poll status page.
- Expected: /api/v1/documents/process-status/:jobId responses include jobMetadata; Neon tables update after completion.

### 5. Compliance Dashboard Refresh
- [ ] Navigate to _Comprehensive Compliance_.
- Expected: Cards reflect latest fleet data via centralized service; no stale figures.

## Artifacts to Capture Post-Run
- Console/network logs: docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/logs-20251007.md.
- Data shapes: docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/data-shapes/ (see README for naming).
- Notes/screenshots: append to this file once execution completes.
