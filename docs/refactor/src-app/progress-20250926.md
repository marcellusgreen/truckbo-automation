# Refactor Progress â€“ 2025-09-26

## Baseline Artifacts Captured
- TypeScript diagnostics saved to docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/tsc-baseline-20250926.log (captures current compiler errors in App.tsx).
- Git snapshot + diff stat recorded at docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/git-baseline-20250926.log (notes existing deletions of legacy test harnesses plus local changes to document processor).
- Tooling versions logged in docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/tooling-baseline-20250926.txt.
- Smoke test checklist template created at docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/smoke-20250926.md; placeholder log summary file and data-shape README added for future runs.

## Code Instrumentation Completed
### src/services/persistentFleetStorage.ts
- Added refactor debug utilities import.
- Wrapped getFleetAsync, ddVehicle, updateVehicle, and clearFleet with timing + conditional efactorDebugLog outputs for success/error paths.

### src/services/centralizedFleetDataService.ts
- Imported refactor debug helpers.
- Instrumented:
  - ddVehicles: start/end markers, persistent result metrics, reconciler error logging (per-VIN), initialize-data checkpoint, and failure tracking.
  - initializeData: start timer, initial counts, Promise.all metrics, completion stats, and error capture.
  - clearAllFleetData: start timer, per-operation errors, completion/failure summaries, and catch block logging.
- Added optional debug hook points in other flows triggered by the service (e.g., source counts, final vehicle totals).

### Document Pipeline Instrumentation
- Added refactor debug hooks in documentStatusPoller and documentProcessor to trace job lifecycle and batch progress when VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG is enabled.
- Event bus now mirrors the debug flag to snapshot emitted events in a bounded buffer for post-run analysis.
- DocumentUploadModal now emits refactor debug telemetry across selection, processing, and acceptance flows when VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG is enabled.

## Pending/Not Started
- Baseline smoke tests, telemetry log capture, and data-shape JSON exports still need to be executed outside the CLI harness.
- Need to clean up minor formatting introduced during instrumentation (extra blank lines) once refactor progresses.
## Suggested Next Steps
1. Gather a short log capture with VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true to validate the new DocumentUploadModal events.
2. Run the smoke checklist in a local dev environment with VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true; archive console/network logs in docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/logs-20250926.md and capture data shape JSON outputs.
3. Review instrumentation logs for noise; adjust metadata fields before moving to Phase 1 dependency mapping.
4. Start dependency map (docs/refactor/src-app/dependency-map.md) capturing current state usage in src/App.tsx.
