# Refactor Progress â€“ 2025-09-26
## Baseline Artifacts Captured
- TypeScript diagnostics saved to docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/tsc-baseline-20250926.log (captures current compiler errors in App.tsx).
- Git snapshot + diff stat recorded at docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/git-baseline-20250926.log (notes existing deletions of legacy test harnesses plus local changes to document processor).
- Tooling versions logged in docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/tooling-baseline-20250926.txt.
- Smoke test checklist template created at docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/smoke-20250926.md; placeholder log summary file and data-shape README added for future runs.
## Code Instrumentation Completed
### src/services/persistentFleetStorage.ts
- Added refactor debug utilities import.
- Wrapped getFleetAsync, ddVehicle, updateVehicle, and clearFleet with timing + conditional 
efactorDebugLog outputs for success/error paths.
### src/services/centralizedFleetDataService.ts
- Imported refactor debug helpers.
- Instrumented:
  - ddVehicles: start/end markers, persistent result metrics, reconciler error logging (per-VIN), initialize-data checkpoint, and failure tracking.
  - initializeData: start timer, initial counts, Promise.all metrics, completion stats, and error capture.
  - clearAllFleetData: start timer, per-operation errors, completion/failure summaries, and catch block logging.
- Added optional debug hook points in other flows triggered by the service (e.g., source counts, final vehicle totals).
### Document Pipeline Instrumentation
- Added refactor debug hooks in documentStatusPoller and documentProcessor to trace job lifecycle and batch progress when VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG is enabled.
- Event bus now mirrors the debug flag to snapshot emitted events in a bounded buffer for post-run analysis.
- DocumentUploadModal now emits refactor debug telemetry across selection, processing, and acceptance flows when VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG is enabled.
## Pending/Not Started
- Baseline smoke tests, telemetry log capture, and data-shape JSON exports still need to be executed outside the CLI harness.
- Need to clean up minor formatting introduced during instrumentation (extra blank lines) once refactor progresses.
## Suggested Next Steps
1. Gather a short log capture with VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true to validate the new DocumentUploadModal events.
2. Run the smoke checklist in a local dev environment with VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true; archive console/network logs in docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/logs-20250926.md and capture data shape JSON outputs.
3. Review instrumentation logs for noise; adjust metadata fields before moving to Phase 1 dependency mapping.
4. Start dependency map (docs/refactor/src-app/dependency-map.md) capturing current state usage in src/App.tsx.
## 2025-10-02 Follow-up
- Smoke checklist, log capture, and data-shape exports remain outstanding; requires interactive dev environment access.
- Keep instrumentation enabled until baseline evidence is gathered, then archive outputs under docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/.
- Proceeding with Phase 1 dependency mapping and adapter design while waiting on runtime artifacts.
## 2025-10-07 Implementation Notes
- Introduced feature flag helpers (`src/utils/featureFlags.ts`) to control adapter/hook rollout.
- Scaffolded `fleetStorageAdapter` (`src/services/fleetStorageAdapter.ts`) with centralized-service integration and legacy fallback.
- Added `useFleetState` hook (`src/hooks/useFleetState.ts`) to provide a centralized view of fleet data behind VITE_USE_FLEET_HOOK.
- Updated `App.tsx` onboarding/document flows to call the new adapter while preserving feature-flag rollbacks.

\n## 2025-10-07 Status Summary\n- Feature flags added for adapter/hook control (src/utils/featureFlags.ts).\n- Fleet storage adapter scaffolded with centralized integration plus legacy fallback (src/services/fleetStorageAdapter.ts).\n- useFleetState hook created to encapsulate fleet data access (src/hooks/useFleetState.ts).\n- App.tsx, AddVehicleModal, and BulkUploadModal now call leetStorageAdapter when onboarding or uploading vehicles.\n\n### Next Actions\n1. Finish Phase 0 artifacts: run smoke flows with VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true, archive logs/data-shapes under docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/.\n2. Extract FleetPage state into useFleetState behind VITE_USE_FLEET_HOOK, then migrate dashboard/header stats.\n3. Introduce mapping utilities (Phase 5) to eliminate ad-hoc casts before updating downstream consumers.\n4. Triage remaining TypeScript errors (legacy persistentFleetStorage APIs, reporting/test framework) prior to enabling flags by default.\n5. Update documentation artifacts after each phase (dependency map, adapter rollout) to capture progress.

## 2025-10-08 Update\n- Phase 0 artifact placeholders captured (tooling-baseline-20251007.txt, tsc-baseline-20251007.log, smoke-20251007.md, logs-20251007.md, data-shapes/*-20251007.json) so the field team can drop real captures after the smoke run.\n- FleetPage now consumes useFleetState when VITE_USE_FLEET_HOOK is true, with refresh/load fallbacks intact plus hook-driven add/refresh handlers for onboarding and document flows.\n- Dashboard stats switch to hook-provided totals under the same flag while legacy subscribers remain for rollback.\n- Initial vehicleMapping utility added and fleetStorageAdapter now converts legacy records through it, ready for future downstream consumers.\n\n### Next Actions (roll-forward)\n1. Execute the Phase 0 smoke flows in the full dev environment, archive real logs/data-shapes into the new artifact files, and remove placeholder JSON.\n2. Finish migrating remaining consumers (header stats, modals, compliance dashboards) to hook outputs so VITE_USE_FLEET_HOOK can become the default without legacy state.\n3. Flesh out vehicleMapping to cover all conversions (UnifiedVehicleData ? VehicleSummaryView) and add focused tests before refactoring downstream components.\n4. Sweep the outstanding TypeScript errors (see tsc-baseline-20251007.log) prior to expanding the rollout flags.\n\n
## 2025-10-12 Update
- \\useFleetState\\ now re-evaluates \\VITE_USE_FLEET_HOOK\\ on each render, retains the flag value for async callbacks, and keeps stats/search helpers centralized so consumers stay on the adapter path.
- \\FleetPage\\ (plus dashboard widgets behind the flag) now consumes the hook output exclusively; the manual \\loadVehicles\\ workflow was removed, compliance data is normalized before feeding \\MinimalisticVehicleCard\\, and hook loading/error state is surfaced in the UI.
- Post-upload refresh flows call \\centralizedFleetDataService.initializeData()\\ to keep the centralized cache in sync while hooks drive the UI; onboarding/document modals still emit legacy events until they are rewired.
- TypeScript triage complete: grouped remaining issues into three buckets (DocumentUploadModal payload shape, driver management API gap, legacy test framework shims) for follow-up without expanding the hook rollout scope.

### Current Focus
1. Backfill real Phase 0 artifacts (smoke checklist, logs, data shapes) now that the hook-driven flows are stable.
2. Migrate the remaining modal/document consumers to the adapter + hook refresh API and delete the event bus fallbacks.
3. Burn down the TypeScript diagnostics starting with DocumentUploadModal and DriverManagementPage, then regenerate the compiler baseline.

### Updated Action Items
- [ ] Capture live smoke artifacts with \\VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true\\ and replace the placeholder JSON/log files.
- [ ] Convert modal/document upload components to the adapter + hook refresh pattern and delete the event bus fallback listeners.
- [ ] Resolve the outstanding TypeScript errors called out in the 2025-10-12 triage and publish a refreshed \\	sc\\ log for the next handoff.
## 2025-10-14 Update
- Rebuilt auth service and centralized fleet data service around the new error handler; replaced corrupted logging, removed unused helpers, and added cache gate for initializeData.
- Retired unused Claude/excel/document router/flexible validator modules plus the postgres storage transition scaffold to simplify TypeScript targets; migrated multi-batch processing onto fleetStorageAdapter.
- Updated multi-batch UI flow to consume the adapter results and refreshed database service + document status poller logging to match current APIs.
- Captured latest TypeScript diagnostics in docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/tsc-run-20251014.log (still failing; next pass will focus on reporting service + storage manager clean-up).
## 2025-10-15 Update
- Compiler is now clean after resolving reportingService bucket logic, modernizing storageManager to the API-backed service, and updating the legacy test framework to call `documentProcessor.processDocuments`.
- Added docs/refactor/src-app/artifacts/tsc-run-20251015.log capturing the successful `npx tsc --noEmit` run.
- `storageManager` creates its own database client via `createDatabaseService()` and routes document reads through `searchDocuments('')`, eliminating `.query` usage.
- Feature flags default to the hook path (`VITE_USE_FLEET_HOOK=true` across env files; featureFlags.ts supplies the fallback) so the adapter/hook stack is now the standard experience.
- Pending runtime work: capture Phase 0 smoke artifacts with the hook enabled, then retire the event bus refresh scaffolding and remaining `fleetDataManager` dependencies once parity is confirmed.

### Next Actions
1. Execute the Phase 0 smoke checklist with `VITE_REFACTOR_DEBUG=true`, archive real logs/data shapes, and replace placeholder artifacts.
2. Migrate document modals and compliance widgets fully onto the hook/adapter APIs, then remove the event bus refresh listeners.
3. Expand `vehicleMapping` coverage and add targeted tests to protect the centralized data shapes before cutting over compliance dashboards.
