- Browser with developer tools for debugging

### Test Data
- **20 Registration Documents** (truck_001_registration through truck_020_registration)
- **20 Insurance Documents** (truck_001_insurance through truck_020_insurance)  
- **File Formats**: Initially .txt (need to convert to supported formats)
- **Fleet Details**: Sunbelt Trucking LLC, DOT 1234567, TRK001-TRK020 plates

## 🧪 Test Cases

### TC001: File Format Support Validation
**Objective**: Verify only supported file formats are processed
**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Fleet Management → Document Processing
2. Attempt to upload files in various formats:
   - ✅ Supported: .pdf, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .tiff, .doc, .docx
   - ❌ Unsupported: .txt, .csv, .xls, .zip
3. Verify appropriate error messages for unsupported formats

**Expected Results**:
- Supported formats accepted for processing
- Unsupported formats rejected with clear error message
- No system crashes or unexpected behavior

**Current Issue**: Mock documents are .txt format (unsupported)
**Status**: ❌ BLOCKED - Need to convert mock files to PDF format

### TC002: Document Classification Accuracy
**Objective**: Test automatic registration vs insurance document detection
**Steps**:
1. Upload mixed batch of registration and insurance documents
2. Verify system correctly identifies document types based on:
   - Filename patterns (registration, insurance, policy, etc.)
   - Document content analysis
3. Check classification confidence scores

**Expected Results**:
- 100% accuracy for clearly named files
- >80% accuracy for content-based classification
- Reasonable confidence scores (>0.7 for clear cases)

### TC003: Vehicle Data Extraction
**Objective**: Validate AI extraction of vehicle information
**Test Data Per Document**:
- VIN: 17-character alphanumeric (e.g., 1XKWD49X1KJ123001)
- License Plate: State format (e.g., TRK001)
- Year: 4-digit year (e.g., 2023)
- Make: Vehicle manufacturer (e.g., PETERBILT)
- Model: Vehicle model (e.g., 579)
- DOT Number: 7-digit number (1234567)

**Steps**:
1. Upload single document with known data
2. Compare extracted data with expected values
3. Verify extraction confidence scores
4. Test with documents having missing/unclear data

**Expected Results**:
- 100% accuracy for clearly printed data
- Extraction confidence >0.8 for complete documents
- Graceful handling of missing fields

### TC004: Truck Number Auto-Detection
**Objective**: Test intelligent truck number parsing from license plates
**Test Cases**:
- TRK001 → "Truck #001"
- TRK047 → "Truck #047" 
- UNIT123 → "Unit 123"
- DOT1234567 → "Unit 567" (from DOT number)

**Steps**:
1. Upload documents with various license plate formats
2. Verify truck number auto-detection accuracy
3. Check source attribution (license plate vs DOT vs VIN)
4. Validate fallback mechanisms

**Expected Results**:
- 100% detection rate for TRK### format
- >90% overall truck number detection
- Clear source attribution in processing notes

### TC005: Bulk Processing Performance
**Objective**: Test system performance with large document batches
**Test Scenarios**:
- Small batch: 5 documents
- Medium batch: 20 documents (full fleet)
- Large batch: 40 documents (registration + insurance)

**Metrics to Track**:
- Processing time per document
- Memory usage during processing
- Success rate vs batch size
- System responsiveness

**Expected Results**:
- <5 seconds per document average
- Linear scaling with batch size
- No memory leaks or crashes
- UI remains responsive

### TC006: Error Handling & Recovery
**Objective**: Test system resilience with problematic files
**Test Cases**:
1. **Corrupted Files**: Upload damaged/incomplete files
2. **Empty Files**: Upload 0-byte files
3. **Wrong Format**: Upload non-document files (images of cats, etc.)
4. **Missing Data**: Documents with no VIN or license plate
5. **Network Interruption**: Simulate connection issues during processing

**Expected Results**:
- Graceful error messages for each scenario
- System continues processing other files
- Clear identification of problematic files
- No data corruption or system crashes

### TC007: Data Integration Validation
**Objective**: Verify extracted data properly integrates with fleet management
**Steps**:
1. Process complete document set (40 files)
2. Accept processing results
3. Verify vehicles appear in Fleet Management table
4. Check truck number display and search functionality
5. Validate document download links work

**Expected Results**:
- All 20 trucks appear in fleet table
- Truck numbers display as "Truck #001" format
- Search works for truck numbers (#001, 001, Truck 001)
- Vehicle details match extracted data

### TC008: User Experience & UI Testing
**Objective**: Validate user-friendly document processing workflow
**Steps**:
1. Test folder upload vs individual file selection
2. Verify file preview before processing
3. Check progress indicators during processing
4. Validate review screen clarity
5. Test mobile/tablet responsiveness

**Expected Results**:
- Intuitive upload interface
- Clear progress feedback
- Easy data review and correction
- Responsive design on all devices

## 🐛 Current Issues Identified

### Issue #1: File Format Support
**Problem**: Mock documents are .txt format, but system only supports image/PDF formats
**Impact**: Cannot test document processing with current mock data
**Solution**: Convert mock .txt files to PDF format using automated script

### Issue #2: OCR Implementation
**Problem**: Current OCR implementation has placeholder code
**Impact**: Real document processing won't work with scanned documents
**Solution**: Integrate Tesseract.js for actual OCR functionality

### Issue #3: PDF Processing
**Problem**: PDF text extraction uses placeholder implementation
**Impact**: Cannot process real PDF documents
**Solution**: Integrate pdf-parse library for PDF text extraction

## 🔧 Required Fixes

### Fix #1: Convert Mock Documents to PDF
```bash
# Convert .txt files to PDF using Node.js script
node convert_to_pdf.js
```

### Fix #2: Add Text File Support (Quick Fix)
```typescript
// Add .txt to supported formats for testing
private readonly SUPPORTED_FORMATS = ['.pdf', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.tiff', '.doc', '.docx', '.txt'];
```

### Fix #3: Update OCR Implementation
```typescript
// Integrate Tesseract.js for image OCR
import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';
```
